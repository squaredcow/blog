## Hey there:
Welcome, I am **Luis Vaca** (squaredcow) owner and author of this blog.

Once I read on LinkedIn: _"If you cannot explain in five words what do you do for a living, you are probably lying"_. 
That said, I am a **programmer** and I enjoy it. 

Now, if I may give the **verbose** self-description: I am a programmer, graduated as 
Software Engineer, +10 years ago, focused on Web Services and Distributed Systems. 
I have been writing code for big-tech companies, start-ups, consultant firms 
and now, in this blog, for **myself**.

Some of my topics of interest circle around programming languages, hashing, frameworks, 
optimizations, clever algorithms, generative art, et cetera. But I know, **you** the reader, will figure that out.

Long due **gratitude**; This blog is meant for my peers, mentors, mentees, and all the new readers out there. 
May you find my findings as **amusing** as I did. 

And if you are interested in more, you can find the **licensing** for all the content 
of this page in [here](https://squaredcow.dev/license).
