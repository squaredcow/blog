# Before the next 90's

The lab door opens after the third beep. Piets enter the laboratory. 

_"Morning,"_ he says, a bit incredulous upon seeing his laboratory assistant already sit in his chair this early in the morning. As Piet approaches Bastian's desk he notices his morning hair and the fact that he is wearing flip-flops that Bastian pulled an all-nighter here, again.

_"This is an unheatlhy habit, Bas"_, Piet starts. _"There is no need for anyone of us to stay longer than we need to,"_ Piet continues, _""_. Upon a brief silence, Piet leans towards Bastian. _"Hey, Bastian! buddy, are you listening?"_ while he gives him a quick pat on the shoulder.

Bastian snaps out of the mid-sleep he was. _"Oh! Good morning"_, he says, with a rough voice and upon quickly clearing it up he enounces, _"Good morning, Doctor"_.

Piet nods sideways as singal of disapproval. _"I'll put the coffe machine to work. Dos americanos grandes,"_ the doctor enounces with a very bad spanihs accent. Bastian slighly smile upon hearing that and he proceeds to get all hands on desk and wrap up his work from last night before leaving the laboratory to take a shower and a proper breakfast.

_"Any news?"_, Piet asked with a slightly disappointed tone and nuances of exhaustion. _"Come, take a look at this"_, Bastian replied, as Piet approaches to his desk with the cups of coffe. Bastian is ..

_"What's this?"_, Piet asks. As he stares careffully at Bastian's monitor. _"Was that thrown by MRX?"_, he continues and Bastian keeps scrolling down a terminal console output until it reaches the bottom of it. _"What do you think?"_, replies Bastion. At the very end, this blob of text displays:

``` bash

 mrx::console::open
   out:  are you sure that we are awake? 
         it seems to me that yet we sleep, we dream. 
 mrx::console::close

 > $
```

 Dr. Pier van den Berg and his team have been working on MRX Project for almost 20 months, mostrando avances casi nulos. MRIADX-II, el nombre del proyecto es un acronimo corto que hace referencia a 4 cosas, M por el nombre del previo jefe de proyecto y ex-colega del Dr. Piet, "RIA" stands for resilient-in-automata, "X" is for Dr. Piet, he never wanted a direct reference of him in the title, yet he is proud of it and of course, II stand for version 2, the orginal one was the proof of concept that got them a spot in DELTA labs. 

_"Is it quoting someone?, the line feels a bit constructed,"_ Bastion asks, while he selects the output fragment to paste it in the browser's search bar. "Shakespear," calmly answers Dr. Piet while grabbing his chin, as he is trying to focus on the reason of the text and not in the text itself.


"Send me an screenshot please. I'll report this immediately," says the doctor while he is already doing big steps towards his desk. "Ack!", replies Bastian and sip some coffee throug one of the weird shapes of his cup.
