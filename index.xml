Once I read on LinkedIn: &amp;ldquo;If you cannot explain in five words what do you do for a living, you are probably lying&amp;rdquo;. That said, I am a programmer.
Now, if I may give the verbose self-description: I am a programmer, graduated as Software Engineer, +8 years ago, focused on Web Services and Distributed Systems. I have been writing code for big-tech companies, start-ups, consultant firms and now, in this blog, for myself.</description></item></channel></rss>
